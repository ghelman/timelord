    <h2>1. Can I change the time I start working on a day?</h2>
    <p>
      Basically.  You can adjust the current days start time.  On the menu
      choose "View -> Change Start Time" to put it in.  After the change,
      you should notice in the bottom right where it shows the time range
      (8:00 AM - 12:15 PM) that the start time in there has been updated.
